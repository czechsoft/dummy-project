## Documentation for observable-event-func.rosetta

**1. Overview:**

This Rosetta code file defines functions related to asset payout trades and observations within a financial system. It focuses on attaching observations to security finance transactions and calculating reset values for equity payouts. 

**2. Package/module name:** cdm.observable.event

**3. Class/file name:** observable-event-func.rosetta

**4. Detailed Documentation:**

   - **`Create_AssetPayoutTradeStateWithObservations` Function:**
     - **Description:** This function attaches a set of observations to a Security Finance Transaction, creating a `TradeState` object. 
     - **Parameters:**
       - `billingInstruction`: A `BillingRecordInstruction` object representing the billing instruction for the transaction. (1..1)
     - **Return Values:**
       - `tradeState`: A `TradeState` object containing the updated information with attached observations. (1..1)
     - **Important Logic:**
       - Uses aliases to simplify references to specific data within the input `billingInstruction`.
       - Calls the `Create_AssetReset` function to generate a `Reset` object based on the provided observations and date.

   - **`Create_AssetReset` Function:**
     - **Description:** This function defines how to calculate the reset value for an equity payout based on provided observations and a specified date.
     - **Parameters:**
       - `assetPayout`: An `AssetPayout` object representing the payout to which the reset applies. (1..1)
       - `observation`: A collection of `Observation` objects used to compute the reset value. (1..*)
       - `resetDate`: A `date` object specifying the date of the reset. (1..1)
     - **Return Values:**
       - `reset`: A `Reset` object containing the calculated reset value and other relevant information. (1..1)
     - **Important Logic:**
       - Calls `ResolveObservationAverage` to calculate the average observed value from the provided observations.
       - Assigns the calculated average as the `resetValue`.
       - Sets the `resetDate` and assigns the observation data for auditing purposes.

   - **`ResolveObservationAverage` Function:**
     - **Description:** This function provides an interface for resolving a single observation value from a collection of observations, applying the specified averaging method if provided.
     - **Parameters:**
       - `observations`: A collection of `Observation` objects. (1..*)
     - **Return Values:**
       - `resetValue`: A `Price` object representing the calculated average value. (1..1)
     - **Important Logic:**
       - Ensures that all observations have matching units before calculating the average.
       - Calculates the sum of observed values and divides by the number of observations to get the average.
       - Sets the `resetValue` with the calculated average, unit, perUnitOf, priceExpression, and priceType from the first observation.

**5. Pseudo Code:**


```
// Function: Create_AssetPayoutTradeStateWithObservations(billingInstruction)
  1. Set tradeState to billingInstruction -> tradeState
  2. Add resetHistory to tradeState using Create_AssetReset function with:
     - assetPayout: billingInstruction -> assetPayout
     - observation: billingInstruction -> observation
     - resetDate: billingInstruction -> recordEndDate

// Function: Create_AssetReset(assetPayout, observation, resetDate)
  1. Set resetValue to the result of ResolveObservationAverage function with observations
  2. Set reset -> resetDate to resetDate
  3. Add each observation from the input list to reset -> observations
  4. Set averagingMethodology -> averagingMethod -> calculationMethod in reset to Arithmetic

// Function: ResolveObservationAverage(observations)
  1. Get first observedValue from observations
  2. Check if all observations have matching units with the first observedValue
     - If not, throw an error indicating unit mismatch
  3. Calculate average value by summing all observed values and dividing by the number of observations
  4. Set resetValue -> value to the calculated average
  5. Set resetValue -> unit, perUnitOf, priceExpression, and priceType from the first observedValue

```



**Dependencies and Libraries:**


- The code relies on several internal modules within the `cdm` namespace: 
    - `cdm.base.math`: Likely provides mathematical functions used in calculations.
    - `cdm.event.common`:  Probably contains common event handling classes or interfaces.
    - `cdm.observable.asset`: Defines classes related to observable assets and their properties.
    - `cdm.product.template`:  May contain templates or definitions for financial products.

- **Equivalent Libraries in Other Languages:**


   - Due to the specific nature of the code and its reliance on internal modules, direct equivalents in other languages are difficult to suggest without further context. 
   - However, you could look for libraries that provide similar functionality in areas like:
      - Financial modeling (e.g., QuantLib, PyPortfolioOpt)
      - Event handling and processing (e.g., Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ)
      - Data structures and algorithms (e.g., Python's standard library, Java Collections Framework)
