## Legal Documentation - Master Agreement Concepts

**1. Overview:**

This code defines a schema for representing master agreement concepts within a legal documentation system. It utilizes types to define clauses, variants, variables, and elections associated with different master agreement types like GMSLA, GMRA, and ISDA Master Agreements. 

The schema aims to provide a structured representation of master agreements, allowing for flexibility in defining specific clauses, variants, and their associated details.

**2. Package/module name:**

cdm.legaldocumentation.master

**3. Class/file name:**

type.rosetta (This file likely defines the types used within the schema)

**4. Detailed Documentation:**


* **Type: MasterAgreementSchedule:**
    - **Description:** Represents a set of elections that specify a Master Agreement. 
    - **Parameters:** None
    - **Return Values:** None
    - **Important Logic:**  Defines an array of `MasterAgreementClause` objects, indicating the clauses included in the master agreement.

* **Type: MasterAgreementClause:**
    - **Description:** Defines individual clauses that make up a Master Agreement.
    - **Parameters:** None
    - **Return Values:** None
    - **Important Logic:**  Includes identifiers, names, counterparty roles, other party roles, and an array of `MasterAgreementClauseVariant` objects to define different variants for the clause.

* **Type: MasterAgreementClauseVariant:**
    - **Description:** Sets the details for a specific variant associated with a clause in a Master Agreement.
    - **Parameters:** None
    - **Return Values:** None
    - **Important Logic:**  Includes identifiers, names, counterparty roles, other party roles, and an array of `MasterAgreementVariableSet` objects to define additional variables specific to the variant.

* **Type: MasterAgreementVariableSet:**
    - **Description:** Defines a type where additional variables associated with clauses and their variants can be described.
    - **Parameters:** None
    - **Return Values:** None
    - **Important Logic:**  Includes nested `variableSet` objects to allow for hierarchical definition of variables, along with name and value pairs.

* **Type: MasterAgreementBase:**
    - **Description:** A set of shared elections that can be used as a base for specific master agreement types.
    - **Parameters:** None
    - **Return Values:** None
    - **Important Logic:**  Provides a foundation for defining more specific master agreements by inheriting from this base type.

* **Type: MasterAgreementElections:**
    - **Description:** A representation of a master agreement extended from a base agreement of shared elections.
    - **Parameters:** None
    - **Return Values:** None
    - **Important Logic:**  Includes references to specific master agreement types like GMSLA, GMRA, and ISDA Master Agreement through their respective election sets.


**5. Pseudo Code:**

```
// Class: MasterAgreementSchedule
function createMasterAgreementSchedule():
  1. Create a new instance of MasterAgreementSchedule.
  2. Initialize an empty array to store clauses.
  3. Add clauses to the array as needed, each represented by a MasterAgreementClause object.
  4. Return the newly created MasterAgreementSchedule object.

// Class: MasterAgreementClause
function createMasterAgreementClause(identifier, name, counterpartyRole, otherPartyRoles):
  1. Create a new instance of MasterAgreementClause.
  2. Set the identifier using the provided value.
  3. Set the name using the provided value (optional).
  4. Set the counterparty role using the provided value (optional).
  5. Add each other party role to the array of otherPartyRoles.
  6. Initialize an empty array to store variants.
  7. Return the newly created MasterAgreementClause object.

// Class: MasterAgreementClauseVariant
function createMasterAgreementClauseVariant(identifier, name, counterpartyRole, otherPartyRoles, variableSet):
  1. Create a new instance of MasterAgreementClauseVariant.
  2. Set the identifier using the provided value.
  3. Set the name using the provided value (optional).
  4. Set the counterparty role using the provided value (optional).
  5. Add each other party role to the array of otherPartyRoles.
  6. Add the variableSet to the array of variables.
  7. Return the newly created MasterAgreementClauseVariant object.

// Class: MasterAgreementVariableSet
function createMasterAgreementVariableSet(name, value):
  1. Create a new instance of MasterAgreementVariableSet.
  2. Set the name using the provided value.
  3. Set the value using the provided value.
  4. Return the newly created MasterAgreementVariableSet object.

// Class: MasterAgreementBase
function createMasterAgreementBase():
  1. Create a new instance of MasterAgreementBase.
  2. Initialize any shared elections or variables common to all master agreements.
  3. Return the newly created MasterAgreementBase object.

// Class: MasterAgreementElections
function createMasterAgreementElections(islaGmsla, icmaGmra, isdaMaster):
  1. Create a new instance of MasterAgreementElections.
  2. Set the islaGmsla using the provided value (optional).
  3. Set the icmaGmra using the provided value (optional).
  4. Set the isdaMaster using the provided value (optional).
  5. Return the newly created MasterAgreementElections object.

**6. Dependencies and Libraries:**


* The code relies on other modules within the `cdm` namespace, specifically:
    * `cdm.base.staticdata.party.*`: Likely provides data structures for representing parties involved in agreements.
    * `cdm.legaldocumentation.master.icma.* as icma`:  Implements or references the ICMA (International Capital Market Association) standard for master agreements.
    * `cdm.legaldocumentation.master.isda.* as isda`: Implements or references the ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) standard for master agreements.
    * `cdm.legaldocumentation.master.isla.* as isla`: Implements or references the ISLA (International Securities Lending Association) standard for master agreements.

* **Equivalent Libraries:**


   -  **ICMA:** 
      - Java: No direct equivalent, but libraries like Apache Avro or Protocol Buffers could be used to define and serialize ICMA data structures.
      - Python: Similar to Java, using libraries like Avro or Protobuf for serialization.
      - C++: Boost Serialization library could be used.

   - **ISDA:** 
      - Java: No direct equivalent, but similar serialization libraries as mentioned above can be used.
      - Python:  Similar to Java.
      - C++: Similar to Java.

   - **ISLA:** 
      - Java: No direct equivalent, but again, Avro or Protobuf could be used for serialization.
      - Python: Similar to Java.
      - C++: Similar to Java.
